# 🤖 ANN Customer Churn Classification

A deep learning project using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether a bank customer will exit (churn) or remain, based on their demographic and account features.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to build a robust binary classification model that predicts customer churn with high accuracy. The model uses common bank features (Credit Score, Geography, Age, Balance, etc.) to determine the probability of a customer leaving the bank.

## 🚀 Live Demo

This model is deployed as an interactive web application using **Streamlit**. You can test the prediction live by adjusting the customer features:

## 💻 Tech Stack & Dependencies

The project relies on the following key libraries, specified in the `requirements.txt` file:

  * **TensorFlow / Keras:** For building and training the Artificial Neural Network.
  * **Streamlit:** For deploying the interactive web application.
  * **Scikit-learn:** For data preprocessing, including scaling (`StandardScaler`) and encoding (`LabelEncoder`, `OneHotEncoder`).
  * **Pandas / NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical operations.
  * **Pickle:** For saving and loading the trained model and preprocessing objects.
